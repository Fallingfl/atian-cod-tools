## Tools

### Mods

Mods implemented in my tool, run `acts mod` for the list.

- `acts mod t8cee` - enable EEs in Custom mutations, offline or casual (Black Ops 4).
- `acts mod t9cee` - enable EEs in offline (Black Ops Cold War).

### Decompiler/Disassembler

Tools to decompile or disassemble the GSC scripts, a bo4 script decompilation is available in the [bo4-source](https://github.com/ate47/bo4-source) and [bocw-source](https://github.com/ate47/bocw-source) repositories.

- gsc disassembler, made in 3 days with a lot of alcohol so don't use it. `acts gscinfo -a -o "output" [input=scriptparsetree]`
- gsc decompiler, same as the disassembler, but 10 days after, not any better. `acts gscinfo -g -o "output" [input=scriptparsetree]`

### GSC Development (Black Ops 4)

Tools to help with the GSC development.

- gsc vm debugger, dump the function stack when the vm has a crash, `acts dbg`
	- can dump the var stack `-s` local var `-v`
	- can look inside structures with the depth for array `-A [depth]` and structs `-S [depth]`  (need the game started)

## Lookup

To have a lookup over the extracted hashes, you can use a file named `strings.txt` when using the process, it will be loaded automatically, one string per line.

## Credits

- Serious's t8-compiler for some opcodes for Black Ops 4, it fasted up the process of understanding the internal game functions. Also for the childthread operator syntax.
